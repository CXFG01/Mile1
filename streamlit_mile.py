Hey there!

This app here uses the power of machine learning(traditional and neural) to help predict the affliction of an individual with Coronary Heart Disease or Myocardial Infraction(Heart Attack).

# By no means is this a medical tool and only a certified doctor can inquire further in your problem.
#Irrelevant of the result, have periodic visits at the doctor to know more about the body's condition.
